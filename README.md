My Website

@Author HTML5 Up Miniport - (Design). PHP/JavaScript additions Michael Butchko

  For my website I wanted to code a larger portion of it by hand to accomplish the features I wanted to display. And thats why I went with HTML5 ups language instead of using Wix, or Squarespace. I added the email form validation both server and client side using PHP and JavaScript. The majority of files have been listed so you can see my thought process on creating this website, as well as my coding habits and personal style.
  
I was using HTML5 ups language to create this website, the original layout can be found here
